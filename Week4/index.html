                A cover letter is a brief one page letter sent along with the resume to potential employers. The 
                purpose of the cover letter is to present yourself to potential employers and to let them know 
                what position you are interested in and why you'd be a good fit to the position and company. 
                Cover Letter Format
                A hard-copy cover letter should be written in the business letter format, while an email should be 
                sent in the same format but without the heading (your return address, their address, and the date). 
                Cover Letter Writing
                Generally the cover letter will consist of three paragraphs. The first paragraph is an introductory 
                one which introduces yourself. You want to include information on the position you are applying 
                for, how you heard about it and why you are interested in the position and/or company. 
                The second paragraph should provide information on your skill, strengths, education, 
                qualifications and/or experience. This paragraph should be concise and give specific examples of 
                why you are the ideal candidate and not simply restate your resume. 
                The final paragraph should close up the letter by requesting an interview and possibly suggest 
                times that are convenient for you or stating that you can come in at a time that's convenient for 
                the employer. Also you should let the recipient know what the best way and/or time to contact 
                you is (you should let them know both your contact email and phone number so that they can 
                contact you in their preferred method). Or you can let them that you'll follow up the letter with a 
                phone call in several days. You should thank them for their time to close up the letter. 
                Each cover letter that you send out should be unique and tailored to the specific company and 
                position you are applying to. Using one cookie cutter cover letter will lessen your chances for 
                landing an interview. Also be sure to check for grammar and spelling and keep the letter to one 
                page in length.</p> </div>
